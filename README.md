# Survey Form

This is a survey form built for the first certification project on freeCodeCamp.

## Description

This project was the first certification project to get the Responsive Web Design certificate on freeCodeCamp, which was about building a survey form using HTML (and CSS). The website only provided some basic testing, but there were no guidelines about the styling side, so I made it look good using CSS.
I set the survey topic as Survey Form for Cookie Baking because baking is one of my favorite hobbies (especially, baking cookies), and I wanted my project to be related to my personal life, which is also why the background and overall pink design of the project represent me.
