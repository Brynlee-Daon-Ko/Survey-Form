# Survey Form

This is a survey form built for the first certification project on freeCodeCamp.

## Description

This was my first certification project for the Responsive Web Design certificate on freeCodeCamp. The task was to build a survey form using HTML and CSS. The site gave some basic tests to pass but didnâ€™t include any design requirements, so I styled it myself to make it look good.

I chose the topic "Survey Form for Cookie Baking" because baking (especially cookies) is one of my favorite hobbies. I wanted the project to reflect something personal, so I used a pink-themed design that matches my style!
